    <p> <!--Preperation-->
        <h2>Preperation</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a stand mixer bowl, combine the dry dough ingredients: Salt, Yeast, Sugar, and Flour</li>
            <li>Heat Water and Milkto 115°F then pour it in the bowl of dry ingredients</li>
            <li>Knead the dough with the hook until it's smooth and elastic (around 1 minute), then add oil and knead for another minute</li>
            <li>Drizzle some oil into the bottom of a deep bowl and place the dough inside. Cover with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place for about 1 hour and 15 minutes</li>
            <li>Remove the plastic wrap and knead the dough a few times. Cover it with plastic again and leave for another 30 minutes. Combine the Farmer's Cheese, Mozzarella, and Feta in the meantime</li>
            <li>Remove the dough from the bowl and place it on a floured surface, cutting it into 4 equal pieces. Speread each piece of dough into a circle about 9 inches in diameter. Then roll 2 opposite sides towards the center so it ends up with a boat-like shape. Then pinch the corners together</li>
            <li>Transfer the dough on to a baking sheet lined with greased parchment paper. Beat 1 egg with a teaspoon of water, then brush the dough with the egg wash. Then stuff each piece of dough with the cheese mixture.</li>
            <li>Bake in the oven at 450°F for about 15 minutes or until the crust becomes golden brown.</li>
            <li>Make a well in the center of each khachapuri with the back of a spoon and drop an egg into each and add butter (optional). Then return to the oven for another 5-10 minutes while the egg is still runny.</li>
        </ol>
